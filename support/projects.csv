Card Game: Set clone,Pretty dang awesome.,/set-clone,"Muldoon whisks in through the double doors. Hammond is right behind him. They go straight to the main console, where RAY ARNOLD fortyish, a chronic worrier and chain-smoker, is seated. ""National Weather Service is tracking a tropical storm about seventy-five miles west of us."" Hammond sighs and looks over Arnold's shoulder. ""Why didn't I build in Orlando?""

Project Euler,Solved 20 problems thus far!,/project-euler,"A snake slithers across a tree branch, past what looks like the large iris of a flower. The flower blinks. It's the eye of the raptor. Muldoon sees it. He raises his gun. Instead of running away again, the raptor rises slowly out of the brush, fully revealing itself to Muldoon, hissing at him. The corners of Muldoon's mouth twitch up into a smile. He draws a bead on the animal. His finger tenses on the trigger. Suddenly, his smile vanishes, both eyes pop open, and a terrible thought sweeps across his face. His eyes flick to the side ""Clever girl"".",project-euler.png,an image from Project Euler that shows I've solved 20 problems!

Scrabble,Ada week 4 project,/scrabble,"John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible. If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free. It expands to new territories. It crashes through barriers. Painfully, maybe even dangerously, but and...well, there it is."" Ellie listens to him, impressed. Watch her head - support her head. Grant, ignoring the others, picks up the baby dinosaur, and holds it on the palm of his hand, under the incubator's heat light. He spreads the tiny animal out on the back of his hand and delicately runs his finger over its tail, counting the vertebrae. A look of puzzled recognition crosses his face. ""You're implying that a group of composed entirely of females will breed?"" ""I'm simply saying that life - - finds a way.",scrabble.png,a view of the rspec test with accompanying scrabble board mockup
