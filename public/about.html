    <p>I'm a freelance writer who has lived in Honolulu, Berlin, and Seattle. You can find my work at CreativeLIVE, Autostraddle, Mic, and all over the Internet.</p>

    <p>I am currently attending the Ada Developers Academy as a full-time student. So my Scribbles-for-Pay are on hold until further notice!</p>
