      About Me

  </h2>
  <p>
    My name is Brittany L Walentin.  I am currenty attending Ada Developer's Academy.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to use this website to showcase my growing programming abilities to potential collaborators and employers.
    I am fortunate enough to be in the 3rd Cohort of Ada Developers Academy,
    (<a href="http://adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Website</a>)
    an intensive program for women transitioning into software development.
    Ada Academy is an amazing program based in Seattle,
    where after a year the amazing women come out of it full stack developers.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the 7 months of instruction I will learn Ruby, Rails, HTML + CSS, Janascript and GIT + Source Control.
    After that, I will begin and internship at one of the sponsoring companies and gain
    real-world knowledge.

      History
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    I grew up in the sunny inland northwest, spending my time with Legos, traipsing around the fields
     near our neighborhood, and gobbling up any books I could put my hands on.
  </p>
  <p>

    From an early age I was an inquisitive child, always wondering “why” and “how”.
    I even had the opportunity to attend Space Camp, where I fostered lifelong ties
    with some very brilliant kids.
    My inquisitiveness lead me to an education in science and a career in Chemistry and Biotechnology.
  <p>

    I have worked in many different environments: retail, service industry,
    oceanography, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry.
    I have always loved thinking critically and solving puzzles, which dovetails
     nicely with being a software developer.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy listening to good tunes, watching cartoons, cats, playing games (tabletop and consoles),
  reading physical books (sorry kindle),and other leisure activities.
</p>
<p>
  You may find me hitting the tennis courts if the weather is nice,
  or if not playing indoor volleyball.
  Alternatively, I could be in costume attending a convention (con) if it’s that season.
</p>
<p>
  I love to learn, enjoy traveling, and strive to make a positive impact daily.

    I was able to get a signed copy of The Oatmeal's book before running the Blerch in 2014.
