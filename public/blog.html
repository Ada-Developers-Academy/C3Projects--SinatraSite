      <h4>Why Ada?</h4>
      <h5>June 1, 2015</h5>
      <p>
        My journey to programming began while completing an MA in Human     Geographyat the University of Washington. I studied the amazing work  folks weredoing with mapping, voluteered geographic information,  and  other digitltech, meanwhile consciously aware I lacked the skills  to engage in this type of creative tech production. So after finishing my MA, I applied to Ada.

        That was in February. Four months later, I'm one month in and have  learned SO MUCH. It's hard, intensive, and I definintely do not get    every concept. But after every project, every assignment, I still t  hink  to myself... this  is fun. Not "tolerable", not "boring, but necess ary." FUN. I actually enjoy doing this. It is fun.

        One month in, and I still have moments when I look around me, and I can't believe I got in. I have never had this kind of exposure to career support, advice, and training. I graduated undergrad in 2008 -- right in time for the great recession. My advisors did not give career advice. The career center did not give career advice. Up until that point, a college degree was still assumed to be a gateway to well-paid work. Hah.

        Graduate school was no better. Nearly every professor in my depa  rtment had gone straight from BA->PhD. They didn't have advice for using my MA in non-academic careers. They had never been in the "real" world. They likely never held a job outside of the ivy tower. Even if they wanted to support you (which my advisors absolutely did), if you weren't working towards a career in academia, their experience was limited. You were own your own .

        So to have this opportunity to learn in a supportive and FUN  environment, with staff who actually want to see us succeed in the   workforce and help guide us towards this goal, is enough to give me   pause every few days, and inwardly thank my f!@#ing lucky stars.
