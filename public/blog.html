        <b>Arrested Development</b><br>
        <em>June 1, 2015</em>
        <p>Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. Coo coo ca chaw. ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward.
          It's a wonderful restaurant! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me.
          She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? This show was cancelled. I mean, COME ON. Michael was having brunch with Sally Sitwell at a restaurant called Skip Church's Bistro. In addition to brunch, the restaurant was known for an item on the menu called the "Skip's Scramble", an omelet that contained everything on the menu. Do not order the Skip's Scramble. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same.
          Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. Annyong. Hair up, glasses off. Are you sure this isn't her sister? Mrs Veal: What a lovely thing to say. Michael: That's an awful thing to say.
          Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard. It's a jetpack, Michael. What could possibly go wrong?
          That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. Wow, this is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken!  ps This one really cracks me up for some reason. Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being WITH you.
          Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. You want your belt to buckle, not your chair. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. But I'm the oldest. The matriarch if you will. But I did finally get into Dad's pants. Although I had to have the crotch taken in a little bit. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? You want your belt to buckle, not your chair.
          I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Shémale. Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. She calls it a Mayonegg. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to. No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.
          Buster, you remember when we were kissing last night? Buster: It was a wild, wild ride. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite… like my heart is getting hard.
        I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. There's a girl in my soup! I shall hide behind the couch. (Guy's a pro.) </p>

        <b>Nietzche</b><br>
        <em>June 1, 2015</em>
        <p>We completed our most recent project 'Bank Accounts' this past weekend. This project gave me more confidence in my understanding of object-oriented programming. Our previous project, FarMar, was a tough start at learning to use modules, classes, and objects in programming. At the completion of Bank Accounts, I felt more confident in my understanding these concepts and was able to use them more comfortably.
