    <h2>Silicon Forrest</h2>
    <h3>June 1st, 2015</h3>
    <p>
      Over the weekend I pondered why it was that San Fransisco has been donned Silicon Valley and New York has been assigned Silicon Alley but there was not a nifty term to refer to the high density of tech in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did find out that Portland (a much less tech heavy) city has claimed silicon forest. Friends this is a call to action, Seattle deserves a tech name and it deserves on now. The road ahead is clear, we must pry silicon forest from the cold dead hands of our Portland nemesis.
