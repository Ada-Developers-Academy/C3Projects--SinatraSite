    The first month of Ada Developer's Academy
  </h2>
  <h3>
    A summary of high and low points
  </h3>
  <p>
    I won't sugar coat it, Ada Developer's Academy is hard.
    It's hard mentally and physically. You are constantly pushing yourself in the long hours
    of the night and morning to perform complex tasks. Because of the demanding schedule, Ada is especially challenging emotionally.
    There is a well-documented phenomena called Imposter Syndrome, wherein you feel
    everyone around you are more qualified than you are. Certainly most of us in my cohort felt
    this at some point or another, either before we started or when we began.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first month is done entirely in the ruby language.
    Our instructors used ruby to teach us the core concepts
    and framework that all languages use.  Ruby is an object-oriented language.
  </p>
  <p>
    I ran up against my first dose of what the heck do I do know on a
    project called Orange Tree.  This was a 3 person group project, which added
    to the complexity of the project involving classes for the first time by
    adding a group dynamic.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for my piece of mind, I revisited this and the following project
    many times that week.  Each time I looked at it again, I would find
    some way to make it more functional, but I was still having a block.
    A fellow student pointed out to me that I was working on the project after we
    just had a full day of learning, and after working on a project for that day's
    homelwork.  My brain wasn't performing at 100% by 10:30 at night,
    especially when I was waking up at 6 in the morning and only snacking for meals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along with fundamentals in programming, after the first month I find myself
    using git regularly to track changes in the ruby scripts I write.
    Additionally, by the end of this month I am writing
     tests in RSPEC in order to perform Test Driven Development (TDD).
  </p>
  <p>
    I, and every other Adie (that's the plural of an Ada student) has made it
    past the inagural month in one piece.  I know that if I need help, I can
    ask any of my fellow classmates and they will have my back. The past cohorts
    of Ada are very willing to help as well, and I feel very fortunate for their help.
    We have fostered an environment of collaboration, not competition, which is wonderful to have
     an a classroom.  I hope this will continue in the coming months.
