# Elsa Moluf - SinatraSite

Hi! This project's requirements are a bit different than the others we've done so far. We will be adding functionality to this project in waves, so, instead of multiple tiers (breakfast/lunch/dinner), I'll be adding requirements in waves.

Each wave describes a minimum feature set for the project and has its own due date. You'll 'turn in' a wave by opening a pull request from your fork to the project master repository. Once it's been reviewed, we'll merge the PR. Rinse and repeat for the next wave. :)

## Wave 1: Learn Sinatra
_The PR for this wave is due by 9am on Wednesday, June 3rd._

The requirements for this wave are:
  - Create a Sinatra application
  - Use that application to serve static HTML pages
  - At least one of the static pages must include at least 2 images
