# Brenna SinatraSite

Hi! This project's requirements are a bit different than the others we've done so far. We will be adding functionality to this project in waves, so, instead of multiple tiers (breakfast/lunch/dinner), I'll be adding requirements in waves.

Each wave describes a minimum feature set for the project and has its own due date. You'll 'turn in' a wave by opening a pull request from your fork to the project master repository. Once it's been reviewed, we'll merge the PR. Rinse and repeat for the next wave. :)

## Wave 1: Learn Sinatra
_The PR for this wave is due by 9am on Wednesday, June 3rd._

The requirements for this wave are:
  - Create a Sinatra application
  - Use that application to serve static HTML pages
  - At least one of the static pages must include at least 2 images

## Wave 2: Use CSS to apply style and struture to our website
_The PR for this wave is due by 10pm on Sunday, June 7th._

The requirements for this wave are:
- Add `class` and/or `id` attributes to your html tags where appropriate
  - Use `class` names that semantically say what the content _is_, not what it looks like.
  - Remember that an `id` must be unique to the _page_.
- Use CSS to...
  - Fix the width of all your entire page to a predetermined size (I'd suggest 960px).
  - Center your content (the blocks, not the text) so that it remains in the middle of the page even if the browser size changes.
  - Add a background color to your repeating page headers and footers.
  - Style your headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) so they are visually distinct.
  - don't use `<br>` tags to separate content; apply `margin` and `padding` where appropriate to space out content.
