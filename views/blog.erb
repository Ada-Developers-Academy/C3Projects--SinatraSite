          Hello all!
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Corinne Pingul and I am proud to be Y-WE’s AmeriCorps member this year!
          My official title with Y-WE is Economic Opportunity Program Coordinator.
          I work to help make the program logistics run smoothly and
          I also help Y-WE provide meaningful job readiness resources for our participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          AmeriCorps asks that all members submit quarterly “Stories of Service” that
          highlight special moments that we experience in our placements with them for their blog.
          As I finish up my first, I thought I would share all my “Stories of Service” with you!
          Below is my first entry that focuses on my introduction to Y-WE and
          the amazing growing opportunities I have had so far. Enjoy!
        </p>
