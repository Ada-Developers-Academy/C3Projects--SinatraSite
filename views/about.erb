  <p>
    Unbelievable! Some idiot disabled his firewall, meaning all the computers on Seven are teeming with viruses, plus I've just had to walk all the way down the motherfudging stairs, because the lifts are broken AGAIN! Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world! I've got Aunt Irma visiting. Oh, do you not like Aunt Irma? I've got an aunt like that. Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble. Might want to play a bit hard to get. I mean, they have no respect for us up there! No respect whatsoever! We're all just drudgeons to them! Hello? I've had a bit of a tumble.
