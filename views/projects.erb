      <h3>Solar System</h3>
      <p>
        This solar system project was great for me to learn how to use instance variables
        and to learn about getter and setter methods.

      <h3>Scrabble</h3>
      <p>
        Scrabble was a lesson in the importance of sudo code and organizing my thoughts before
        writing actual code. In this project, my methods don't follow the single responsibility principle.
        A lot of functionality could have been separated out into different methods.
