  <p>We completed our most recent project 'Bank Accounts' this past weekend. This project gave me more confidence in my understanding of object-oriented programming. Our previous project, FarMar, was a tough start at learning to use modules, classes, and objects in programming. At the completion of Bank Accounts, I felt more confident in my understanding these concepts and was able to use them more comfortably.</p>
