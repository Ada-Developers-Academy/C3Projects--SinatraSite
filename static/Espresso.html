<p>
  In some shape or form I've been a barista for over 14 years. The good part: I love coffee. The bad part: I love cofee.  This 14 years of experience, makes me a pretty freaking opinionated person where coffee and especially espresso are concerned.

  What follows are some of the espresso experiences I've had in my first few weeks here in Seattle:


  (ps - I have the right to change my mind on these. NOTHING is set in stone.)

<h2 class = "subtitle" >Espresso Vivace</h2>
<p> 
  Vivace has been my second favorite. The bean and milk combine for a a very rich, full flavor. Delicious, but missing just a little something. I think it's personality. Maybe I just haven't encountered the right barista yet. 

  They do have amazing almond croissants though.

<h2 class = "subtitle">Cafe Vita</h2>
<p> 
  I love Vita. As does over half of the city.  Almost every restaurant is serving coffee roasted by Vita. But how is there espresso? In a word? Delectable. Hands down, if I'm looking for a cappucino or latte, Vita is where I go. I 'm quite fond of the Pacnor.  

  For pure attitude and taste, Vita wins hands down. The music is always the best, the espress on strong and smooth.

<h2 class = "subtitle">Starbucks</h2>
<p> 
  So lots of folks wanna hate on the mermaid, but Starbucks is where I received my initial training, 14 years ago. When it comes to consistency, no body beats Starbucks. My chai or latte from 3rd and Seneca, tatses like the one from Green Lake, tastes like the one from Fremont, tastes like the one from Pike Place. That's not to be overlooked. 


  Sometimes one simply doesn't want to experiment. You just want a sure thing. At the Bucks, no problem.

<h2 class = "subtitle">Cafe Lladro</h2>
<p>
  Oh Ladro, how I love you. 

  In so many many ways. 

  But ESPECIALLY for your Medici mocha. 

  When so many had given up on the concept of orange and chocolate together ( cough..Starbucks) Ladro has not only kept it, but perfected it. The Medici is bold and complex with layers of fresh orange, mocha, and foam. I highly recommend it. Highly. And before you tell me orange and coffee and chocolate don't go together, TRY IT! I was a skeptic too, then I had the real thing with a big, fat orange rind sittig in the bottome flavoring every sip. tastes. like. heaven. seriously. 
</p>

<h2 class = "subtitle">Broadcast Coffee</h2>
<p>
  Broadcast holds a sweet spot in my heart for a number of reasons. First, It's closest to me. So when I'm craving espresso or coffee or tea, and am too lazy to make it, Broadcast makes it for me. 

  Second, they do solid, B+ work everytime and that's to be lauded. Being so small comes with ts own set of isssues. But they've always been super cool and laid back, and I think that should be rewarded. 

  Broadcast has got the neighborhood coffee market locked. 
</p>

<h2 class = "subtitle">Bauhaus </h2>
<p>
  Everyone I know, love Bauhaus. And it's not that I don't love Bauhaus. They've got the aloof barista thing down. But in terms of quality, the atmosphere at Bauhuas right now, is better than the coffee. 

  To be fair, the barista I had was spankin' new so I will have to go back and give it another try.  I'm sure it will be amazing.
