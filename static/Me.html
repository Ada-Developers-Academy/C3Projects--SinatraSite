<p>
  Just about every damn thing. I'm observant but adventurous. I have a bucket list; because I live eat, sleep, breathe information science it's organized in quadrants of feasibilty on Excel. I'm a trekkie (TNG4EVA), I love to cook, especially without a recipe.  If you see me out and about, I'll probably have yellow on. I don;t have any tattoos. I have a wicked jazz vinyl collection, some from auction, most inherited from my dad - so those mean the world to me since I lost him in 2000. I'm partial to the number 5.
