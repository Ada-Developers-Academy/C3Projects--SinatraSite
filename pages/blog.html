  <h3><a name="applying">Applying to Ada Developers Academy</a></h3>
  <p>Honestly, I found out about Ada in the most randomly serendipitous way possible. A former colleague posted a link to
    <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/blogs/slog/2015/02/13/21704378/ada-developers-academy-is-fighting-gender-inequality-in-the-tech-world-one-class-at-a-time">this Stranger article</a>
    on her facebook page about something she was thinking about doing one day. This means by the time I
    found out Ada even existed, there were only ten days until the application deadline.</p>

  <p>I went home that night and started playing with the application materials trying to decide
    if I wanted to submit the application. I stayed up ridiculously late figuring out how to do
    my resume in Markdown, and playing with the dataset until way too late. Given how the hours
    flew by, it seemed like a clear sign that I might just be on to something. The part that
    scared me the most about the application was this 5-minute YouTube video requirement,
    but I talked to my family and friends and they were all really supportive and reaffirmed
    that they could see me taking this path.</p>

  <p>I asked my former boss and an internship supervisor if they would fill out my recommendation
    forms. Both kindly agreed, and I'm sure that their arguments helped strengthen my case!
    I feel so fortunate to have amazing mentors and I want to be sure to make time to connect
    with them when I am back in Seattle.</p>

  <p>With those three parts largely squared away, the last looming piece was the YouTube video
    answering questions. I am blessed with incredibly talented sisters who happen to have skillsets
    in film and design, so I of course turned to them for their expertise. I wrote up and recorded
    a script and brought in props, and we spent one late evening recording the video.</p>

  <p>We joked that maybe I should just submit a "making of" video as the rigging of the iphone
    using a gopro suction cup and a duck-taped screw with a tripod, but because #rules, we finished and
    edited my actual 4-minute, 58-second video which I uploaded to YouTube, hit submit, and hoped for the best!</p>

    <h3><a name="interview">The Ada Interview</a></h3>
    <p>When I got an email 11 days after submission informing me that I had moved on to the interview
      round, I was ecstatic! First barrier-conquered! I had ten days to wait until the scheduled interview time,
      so I did some code tutorials, tried to practice potential interview questions, and made sure my Skype lighting was just right.</p>
