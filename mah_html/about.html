      Aloha, my name is Brandi Wilson.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Hawaii. I went to the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa where I earned a B.A. in English. I lived in Hawaii most of my life, and it will always be my home. Just recently, I was accepted into a program called Ada Developer’s Academy and moved to Seattle, WA to become a programmer.

      I’ve been gaming my entire life on both PC and consoles. I love stories, especially fantasy and science fiction stories: I listen to a lot of audio books and watch a lot of anime and movies. I doodle and write on occasion. And I adore cats.

    (Aside Test) Hawaii is the 50th state, yes, we are part of the United States. And, no, I do not surf.
