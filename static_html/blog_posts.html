      <p>
        Hello all!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Corinne Pingul and I am proud to be Y-WE’s AmeriCorps member this year!
        My official title with Y-WE is Economic Opportunity Program Coordinator.
        I work to help make the program logistics run smoothly and
        I also help Y-WE provide meaningful job readiness resources for our participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        AmeriCorps asks that all members submit quarterly “Stories of Service” that
        highlight special moments that we experience in our placements with them for their blog.
        As I finish up my first, I thought I would share all my “Stories of Service” with you!
        Below is my first entry that focuses on my introduction to Y-WE and
        the amazing growing opportunities I have had so far. Enjoy!
      </p>
